    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Don’t tell your friends from Chicago, but this is an easy take on deep-dish-style pizza. While it’s far from authentic, it sure is delicious! By layering the cheese on first, you get lots of crispy, golden edges—which my family tends to fight over. Since this pizza is quite doughy, it’s best to cut it into thin strips to serve. As for the sauce, less is more. I like to add small dollops all over the surface to ensure even distribution and maximum crispiness. If you’re craving some spice, my favorite topping to hit this with as soon as it comes out of the oven is a hefty drizzle of hot honey</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Focaccia Base</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 (0.25 ounce) packet active-dry yeast (I prefer Red Star®)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pizza Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil, as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mini pepperoni slices (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            <strong>For the focaccia:</strong> Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
        </li></p>
        <li><p>
            Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.
            </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.
            </p></li>
        <li><p>
            After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let rise for 30 minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>For the toppings:</strong> Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            After focaccia is risen, lightly drizzle the surface with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter mozzarella cheese in an even layer.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Use a spoon to dollop the surface with marinara, then sprinkle the top with Parmesan cheese. Top with pepperoni.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until focaccia and cheeses are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
